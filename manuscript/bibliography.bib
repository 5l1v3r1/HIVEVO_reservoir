HIV-infected cells linger even in the face of therapy, and this persistence, termed the latent reservoir, is a major hurdle for curing HIV. HIV integrates itself into the DNA of its host cells. Could that affect the latent reservoir? To find out, Maldarelli et al. drew blood from five HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy and analyzed sites where HIV had inserted itself into the blood cells' DNA (see the Perspective by Margolis and Bushman). In many cases, these sites were not random; HIV often weaseled its way into genes that help cells grow and proliferate. Where HIV integrates into the host genome may thus determine the size of the latent reservoir.

The persistence of HIV-infected cells in individuals on suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) presents a major barrier for curing HIV infections. HIV integrates its DNA into many sites in the host genome; we identified 2410 integration sites in peripheral blood lymphocytes of five infected individuals on cART. About 40\% of the integrations were in clonally expanded cells. Approximately 50\% of the infected cells in one patient were from a single clone, and some clones persisted for many years. There were multiple independent integrations in several genes, including MKL2 and BACH2; many of these integrations were in clonally expanded cells. Our findings show that HIV integration sites can play a critical role in expansion and persistence of HIV-infected cells.
Where HIV integrates into the host genome contributes to viral persistence and the expansion of infected cells. [Also see Perspective by Margolis and Bushman]

The barrier to curing HIV-1 is thought to reside primarily in CD4+ T cells containing silent proviruses. To characterize these latently infected cells, we studied the integration profile of HIV-1 in viremic progressors, individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy, and viremic controllers. Clonally expanded T cells represented the majority of all integrations and increased during therapy. However, none of the 75 expanded T cell clones assayed contained intact virus. In contrast, the cells bearing single integration events decreased in frequency over time on therapy, and the surviving cells were enriched for HIV-1 integration in silent regions of the genome. Finally, there was a strong preference for integration into, or in close proximity to, Alu repeats, which were also enriched in local hotspots for integration. The data indicate that dividing clonally expanded T cells contain defective proviruses and that the replication-competent reservoir is primarily found in CD4+ T cells that remain relatively quiescent.},

	abstract = {The diversity of T-cell receptors recognizing foreign pathogens is generated through a highly stochastic recombination process, making the independent production of the same sequence rare. Yet unrelated individuals do share receptors, which together constitute a "public" repertoire of abundant clonotypes. The TCR repertoire is initially formed prenatally, when the enzyme inserting random nucleotides is downregulated, producing a limited diversity subset. By statistically analyzing deep sequencing T-cell repertoire data from twins, unrelated individuals of various ages, and cord blood, we show that T-cell clones generated before birth persist and maintain high abundances in adult organisms for decades, slowly decaying with age. Our results suggest that large, low-diversity public clones are created during pregnancy, and survive over long periods, providing the basis of the public repertoire.},

	abstract = {Viruses can create complex genetic populations within a host, and deep sequencing technologies allow extensive sampling of these populations. Limitations of these technologies, however, potentially bias this sampling, particularly when a PCR step precedes the sequencing protocol. Typically, an unknown number of templates are used in initiating the PCR amplification, and this can lead to unrecognized sequence resampling creating apparent homogeneity; also, PCR-mediated recombination can disrupt linkage, and differential amplification can skew allele frequency. Finally, misincorporation of nucleotides during PCR and errors during the sequencing protocol can inflate diversity. We have solved these problems by including a random sequence tag in the initial primer such that each template receives a unique Primer ID. After sequencing, repeated identification of a Primer ID reveals sequence resampling. These resampled sequences are then used to create an accurate consensus sequence for each template, correcting for recombination, allelic skewing, and misincorporation/sequencing errors. The resulting population of consensus sequences directly represents the initial sampled templates. We applied this approach to the HIV-1 protease (pro) gene to view the distribution of sequence variation of a complex viral population within a host. We identified major and minor polymorphisms at coding and noncoding positions. In addition, we observed dynamic genetic changes within the population during intermittent drug exposure, including the emergence of multiple resistant alleles. These results provide an unprecedented view of a complex viral population in the absence of PCR resampling.},

Our analysis highlights why HIV-1 infection, which increases the fraction of both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes that are proliferating (Ki67+), leads to CD4 but not CD8 depletion. We find that HIV-1 infection tends to increase the rates of death and proliferation of activated CD4+ T cells, and to increase the rate at which resting CD4 T cells become activated, but does not increase the fraction of activated CD4+ T cells, consistent with their preferential loss in HIV-1-infected individuals. In contrast, HIV-1 infection does not lead to an increase in proliferation or death rates of activated CD8+ T cells, but did increase the fraction of activated CD8+ T cells, consistent with these cells remaining in an activated state longer and undergoing more rounds of proliferation than CD4+ T cells. Our results also explain why telomeres shorten in CD8+ cells, but not in CD4+ cells of HIV-1-infected patients, compared with age-matched controls.},

Using the deuterated (2H) glucose method for endogenous labeling, we have analyzed host factors that influence T-cell turnover in HIV-1-uninfected and -infected humans. In untreated HIV-1 disease, the average half life of circulating T cells was diminished without compensatory increases in cell production. Within 12 weeks of the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the absolute production rates of circulating T cells increased, and normal half-lives and production rates were restored by 12-36 months. Interpatient heterogeneity in the absolute degree of turnover correlated with the relative proportion of naive- and memory/effector-phenotype T cells in each of the CD4+ and CD8+ populations. The half-lives of naive-phenotype T cells ranged from 116-365 days (fractional replacement rates of 0.19-0.60\% per day), whereas memory/effector-phenotype T cells persisted with half-lives from 22-79 days (fractional replacement rates of 0.87-3.14\% per day). Naive-phenotype T cells were more abundant, and the half-life of total T cells was prolonged in individuals with abundant thymic tissue, as assessed by computed tomography. Such interpatient variation in T-cell kinetics may be reflective of differences in functional immune reconstitution after treatment for HIV-1 disease.},

We used two stable isotope-labeling techniques to identify kinetically distinct subpopulations of T cells and to determine the effect of advanced infection with HIV-1. Long-term deuterated water (2H2O) incorporation into DNA demonstrated biphasic accrual of total and of memory/effector (m/e)–phenotype but not naive-phenotype T cells, consistent with the presence of short-lived and longer-lived subpopulations within the m/e-phenotype T cell pool. These results were mirrored by biphasic die-away kinetics in m/e- but not naive-phenotype T cells after short-term 2H-glucose labeling. Persistent label retention was observed in a subset of m/e-phenotype T cells (presumably memory T cells), confirming the presence of T cells with very different life spans in humans. In advanced HIV-1 infection, much higher proportions of T cells were short-lived, compared to healthy controls. Effective long-term anti-retroviral therapy restored values to normal. These results provide the first quantitative evidence that long-lived and quiescent T cells do indeed predominate in the T cell pool in humans and determine T cell pool size, as in rodents. The greatest impact of advanced HIV-1 infection is to reduce the generation of long-lived, potential progenitor T cells.},

In untreated HIV-1-infected subjects (with a mean CD4 level of 342 cells/microl), the half-life of each subpopulation was less than 1/3 as long as those of healthy, HIV-1-seronegative subjects but was not compensated by an increased absolute production rate of CD4+ T cells. After viral replication was suppressed by highly active antiretroviral therapy for 12 weeks, the production rates of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were considerably elevated; the kinetic basis of increased CD4 levels was greater production, not a longer half-life, of circulating cells. These direct measurements indicate that CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia is due to both a shortened survival time and a failure to increase the production of circulating CD4+ T cells.

Pro-viral DNA, corresponding to the C2-V3-C3 region of the HIV-1 env gene, was collected from PBMCs isolated from 57 patients. Both "consensus" (57 patients) and clonal (7 patients) sequences were obtained from five time points spanning a 24-month period. The main computational strategy was to use maximum likelihood to fit a set of alternative phylogenetic models to the clonal data, and then determine the support for models that imply evolution between time points. Model fit and model-selection uncertainty was assessed using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Akaike weights. The consensus sequence data was also analyzed using a range of phylogenetic techniques to determine whether there were temporal trends indicating ongoing replication and evolution. In summary, it was not possible to detect definitive signs of ongoing evolution in either the bulk-sequenced or the clonal data with the methods employed here, but our results could be consistent with localized expression of archival HIV genomes in some patients. Interestingly, stop-codons were present at the same two positions in several independent clones and across patients. Simulation studies indicated that this phenomenon could be explained as the result of parallel evolution and that some sites were inherently more likely to evolve into stop codons.},

Vif achieves this depletion by both impairing the translation of APOBEC3G mRNA and accelerating the posttranslational degradation of the APOBEC3G protein by the 26S proteasome. Vif physically interacts with APOBEC3G, and expression of Vif alone in the absence of other HIV-1 proteins is sufficient to cause depletion of APOBEC3G. These findings highlight how the bimodal translational and posttranslational inhibitory effects of Vif on APOBEC3G combine to markedly suppress the expression of this potent antiviral enzyme in virally infected cells, thereby effectively curtailing the incorporation of APOBEC3G into newly formed HIV-1 virions.},

However, rates of recombination vary dramatically among RNA viruses, which can range from clonal to highly recombinogenic. Here, we review the factors that might explain this variation in recombination frequency and show that there is little evidence that recombination is favoured by natural selection to create advantageous genotypes or purge deleterious mutations, as predicted if recombination functions as a form of sexual reproduction. Rather, recombination rates seemingly reflect larger-scale patterns of viral genome organization, such that recombination may be a mechanistic by-product of the evolutionary pressures acting on other aspects of virus biology.},

	abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomes present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of infected persons or in lymphocytes infected in vitro were studied by long-distance PCR (LD-PCR) using primers localized in the HIV-1 long terminal repeats. The full-length 9-kb DNA was the only LD-PCR product obtained in peripheral and cord blood lymphocytes from seronegative donors infected in vitro. However, a high proportion (27\% to 66\%) of distinct populations of extensively deleted HIV-1 genomes of variable size was detected in PBMCs of 15 of 16 HIV-1-infected persons. Physical mapping of defective genomes showed that the frequency of deletions is proportional to their proximity to the central part of HIV-1 genome, which is consistent with a deletion mechanism involving a single polymerase jump during reverse transcription. Sequencing of deletion junctions revealed the presence of short direct repeats of three or four nucleotides. The number of defective HIV-1 genomes decreased after in vitro activation of PBMCs. Persistence of full-length and deleted genomes in in vitro activated PBMCs correlated with isolation of an infectious virus. Our results represent the first quantitative assessment of intragenomic rearrangements in HIV-1 genomes in PBMCs of infected persons and demonstrate that, in contrast to in vitro infection, defective genomes accumulate in PBMCs of infected persons.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA dynamics during long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) are not defined.
METHODS: Blood mononuclear cells obtained during 7-12 years of effective ART were assayed for total HIV-1 DNA and 2-long terminal repeat (LTR) circles by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Slopes of HIV-1 DNA were estimated by participant-specific linear regressions. Plasma was assayed for residual viremia (HIV-1 RNA) by qPCR.
RESULTS: Thirty participants were studied. HIV-1 DNA decreased significantly from years 0-1 and 1-4 of ART with median decay slopes of -0.86 (interquartile range, -1.05, -0.59) and -0.11 (-0.17, -0.06) log10(copies/10(6) CD4+ T-cells)/year, respectively (P {\textless} .001). Decay was not significant for years 4-7 (-0.02 [-0.06, 0.02]; P = .09) or after year 7 of ART (-0.006 [-0.030, 0.015]; P = .17). All participants had detectable HIV-1 DNA after 10 years (median 439 copies/10(6) CD4+ T-cells; range: 7-2074). Pre-ART HIV-1 DNA levels were positively associated with pre-ART HIV-1 RNA levels (Spearman = 0.71, P {\textless} .001) and with HIV-1 DNA at years 4, 7, and 10 on ART (Spearman ≥ 0.75, P {\textless} .001). No associations were found (P ≥ .25) between HIV-1 DNA slopes or levels and \% activated CD8+ T-cells (average during years 1-4) or residual viremia (n = 18). 2-LTR circles were detected pre-ART in 20/29 and in 8/30 participants at last follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Decay of HIV-1 DNA in blood is rapid in the first year after ART initiation (86\% decline), slows during years 1-4 (23\% decline/year), and subsequently plateaus. HIV-1 DNA decay is not associated with the levels of CD8+ T-cell activation or persistent viremia. The determinants of stable HIV-1 DNA persistence require further elucidation.

Analysis of 213 noninduced proviral clones from treated patients showed 88.3\% with identifiable defects but 11.7\% with intact genomes and normal long terminal repeat (LTR) function. Using direct sequencing and genome synthesis, we reconstructed full-length intact noninduced proviral clones and demonstrated growth kinetics comparable to reconstructed induced proviruses from the same patients. Noninduced proviruses have unmethylated promoters and are integrated into active transcription units. Thus, it cannot be excluded that they may become activated in vivo. The identification of replication-competent noninduced proviruses indicates that the size of the latent reservoir-and, hence, the barrier to cure-may be up to 60-fold greater than previously estimated.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present review summarizes the current challenges for the design of new therapeutic strategies toward HIV eradication in individuals receiving suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We will focus on the experimental evidence suggesting that immunological mechanisms involved in the generation and maintenance of memory CD4+ T cells are also responsible for the establishment and persistence of a stable reservoir for HIV.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies performed on clinical samples obtained from virally suppressed HIV-infected individuals indicate that T-cell survival and homeostatic proliferation, two major mechanisms involved in the maintenance of immunological memory, contribute to the persistence of latently infected memory CD4+ T cells. Thus, the long lifespan characteristic of the HIV reservoir is likely a consequence of the capacity of the immune system to generate and maintain memory CD4+ T cells for a long period.
SUMMARY: These findings suggest that strategies aimed at reducing the pool of latently infected cells should interfere with the survival pathways responsible for the long-term maintenance of memory CD4+ T cells. Because memory CD4+ T cells are critical for appropriate immune defense, targeted approaches are needed to interfere only with the long-term survival of discrete fractions of memory T cells carrying proviral DNA.},

Here we identify central memory (TCM) and transitional memory (TTM) CD4+ T cells as the major cellular reservoirs for HIV and find that viral persistence is ensured by two different mechanisms. HIV primarily persists in TCM cells in subjects showing reconstitution of the CD4+ compartment upon HAART. This reservoir is maintained through T cell survival and low-level antigen-driven proliferation and is slowly depleted with time. In contrast, proviral DNA is preferentially detected in TTM cells from aviremic individuals with low CD4+ counts and higher amounts of interleukin-7–mediated homeostatic proliferation, a mechanism that ensures the persistence of these cells. Our results suggest that viral eradication might be achieved through the combined use of strategic interventions targeting viral replication and, as in cancer, drugs that interfere with the self renewal and persistence of proliferating memory T cells.},

Here we show that virus evolution and trafficking between tissue compartments continues in patients with undetectable levels of virus in their bloodstream. We present a spatial and dynamic model of persistent viral replication and spread that indicates why the development of drug resistance is not a foregone conclusion under conditions in which drug concentrations are insufficient to completely block virus replication.

abstract ={Background. The stability of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reservoir and the contribution of cellular proliferation to the maintenance of the reservoir during treatment are uncertain. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of HIV-1 in T-cell subsets in different tissue compartments from subjects receiving effective antiretroviral therapy (ART).Methods. Using single-proviral sequencing, we isolated intracellular HIV-1 genomes derived from defined subsets of CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood, gut-associated lymphoid tissue and lymph node tissue specimens from 8 subjects with virologic suppression during long-term ART at 2 time points (time points 1 and 2) separated by 7–9 months.Results. DNA integrant frequencies were stable over time (<4-fold difference) and highest in memory T cells. Phylogenetic analyses showed that subjects treated during chronic infection contained viral populations with up to 73\% identical sequence expansions, only 3 of which were observed in specimens obtained before therapy. At time points 1 and 2, such clonally expanded populations were found predominantly in effector memory T cells from peripheral blood and lymph node tissue specimens.Conclusions. Memory T cells maintained a relatively constant HIV-1 DNA integrant pool that was genetically stable during long-term effective ART. These integrants appear to be maintained by cellular proliferation and longevity of infected cells, rather than by ongoing viral replication.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Human cells have conserved antiviral defense systems, which protect against a range of viruses. A key component of this innate, intra-cellular defense is APOBEC3G (hA3G), which can cause extensive and inactivating G-to-A mutations (termed hypermutation) in viral DNA. To circumvent this, human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) encodes a protein, Vif, which can bind hA3 and prevent its antiviral effects. Vif is however, not always fully efficient, and many HIV-1 infected patients harbor hypermutated sequences. A key question is whether hA3G also might generate sub-lethal levels of G-to-A mutations, which could increase viral evolution, possibly accelerating disease progression. If this were to occur, drugs and vaccine-induced CTL-responses targeting Vif might have counterproductive effects. We show through in vitro, in vivo, and in silico analyses that it is unlikely that hA3G-activity can enhance virus evolution. Thus, measures that inhibit the interaction between Vif and APOBEC3G are likely to only increase the fraction of hypermutated, inactivated HIV sequences in the infected host.},

   abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) production continues in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with undetectable (<50 copies/mL) virus loads. Our initial cross-sectional study showed that this viremia is composed of viruses that lack new resistance mutations to the HAART regimen. Here we describe a longitudinal, clonal genotypic analysis of plasma virus loads in treated adults who had undetectable virus loads. We document a continuous production of virus in 8 HIV-1-infected adults who maintained suppression of viremia for up to 15 months. Using analytical approaches for distinguishing selected resistance mutations from nonselected mutations and polymerase chain reaction errors, we detected no evolution of resistance in the reverse-transcriptase and protease genes. Sporadic resistance mutations were detected in some viral clones that were not selected for subsequently. Thus, in some patients, HAART suppresses replication to a level that does not allow the evolution of drug resistance over a time frame of years.},
